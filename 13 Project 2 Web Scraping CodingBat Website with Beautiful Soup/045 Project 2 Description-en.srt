00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,600
Hello everyone. In this video, I am going

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,600
to explain to you your first project.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,000
So I have the site opened here, "codingbat.com".

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,920
This website has questions of Java and Python and

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,920
it helps you learn Java and Python questions especially

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,500
for competitions for different competitions like ICPC.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,980
OK, so you can see that you have

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,240
a compiler, you have a sort of thing

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,240
where you can type code and then you can say

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,100
"Go" and then you can see the solution for it and

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,580
there are multiple questions here.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,640
I mean there are many questions you can find.

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,440
So the flow for this website is that there are sections.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:54,710
As you can see for Java you have "Warmup-1", "Warmup-2",

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:54,710
then "Strings" and "Array" and "Logic-1" and "Logic-2", "Array-2"

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:02,640
"Array-3", "AP-1", then "Recursion-1" then "Map-1" and

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:02,640
"Map-2" and then if I click let's say I click on "Warmup-1"

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,240
which I've opened here.

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,960
So as soon as I open this,

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,960
you can see I have questions here.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,540
So for each section you get questions, like

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,540
you open the section you get questions.

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:23,900
You can see them here, like "sleepIn" is a question. Each of these listed links

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,080
are links to questions.

25
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,630
So when I open "sleepIn", it opens this.

26
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,630
This is a question here.

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,270
OK.

28
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,630
So you can see that this is a question and this here,

29
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:41,810
the three statements here, they are example

30
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:41,810
inputs and exemple outputs, the required

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,910
outputs.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,790
So the question is this one here and the example inputs

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,790
and outputs are this one here. So the "sleepIn"

34
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,910
takes "false" and "false" as its inputs and then it returns "true".

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,520
It returns us "true" if the inputs are "false" and "false".

36
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,760
So these are sample inputs and this is a sample output.

37
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,100
So once again the flow is like you have sections here.

38
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,660
Then as I open the section, each section has many

39
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,660
questions, so multiple questions and then I open

40
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,060
a single question and I get this here,

41
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,060
where I can type code and everything.

42
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,370
And here I have a question here, a question

43
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,370
statement and then the question examples.

44
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:31,830
So what I want you to do is I want you

45
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:31,830
to scrape each question and the examples for that

46
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,660
question and I want you to give

47
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,660
this to me in a standardized format.

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,880
Once again we opened the site.

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,370
This page opens, this has sections here.

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,390
Each section has questions.

51
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,370
These are questions "sleepIn", "monkeyTrouble",

52
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,370
"sumDouble", "endUp, "icyHot", "startHi".

53
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,780
So as soon as you open the question, you get this window

54
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,780
and in this window you can see that this is the

55
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,660
question here.

56
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,580
This is a question and this is a sample input/output.

57
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,820
So basically I wanted the whole of this.

58
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,820
I want this highlighted data.

59
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,960
I want all of these questions that are present here

60
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,960
in this CodingBat for Java, not for Python. Only for

61
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,460
a Java.

62
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,900
So my hint is what you can do is you can

63
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,900
scrape this first like the links for these sections.

64
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:36,510
Then you can open them in a loop and then

65
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:36,510
for this page you scrape the questions like the link

66
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,800
for these questions and then you open each question

67
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,800
in aloop and then you get the desired values

68
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,370
and then you can make a dictionary or a list, that depends

69
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,370
on you, but the output should be in a standardized

70
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,200
format.

71
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:58,250
I hope the project description is clear to you

72
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:58,250
and I've given you a hand, a big one,

73
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,140
as to how you can do this.

74
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,980
And I'll see you in the next video with the solution.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,870
But I would really appreciate if you do this yourself first.

76
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,400
I am sure you can do this.

77
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,690
Thank you very much.

78
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,180
See you.
