Hello everyone! In the last video,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,330
we discussed how we can move up our

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,590
parse tree.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,910
A quick preview, if I have this "p" tag,

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,910
how can access this "body" tag here,

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,880
its parent.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,040
In this video, we are going to discuss the ".parents" method.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,520
The ".parents" method basically is that

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,520
how we can access all the parents of a particular tag.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:35,220
So this method returns us a list of parents.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,280
By list

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:48,840
I mean it returns us a generator and you can

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:48,840
actually iterate with this generator to

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,020
get the parents, all the parents, of a particular tag.

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:01:03,550
So let's say I'm going to access this first "a" tag.

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:01:03,550
You can see this "a" tag has its first parent as this "p" tag,

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,510
the story one, and then this "p" tag has its parent as this "body" tag.

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:18,210
And then this body has this "html" and "html"

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:18,210
has this Beautiful Soup of the document as its parent.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,080
So I say "link" is equals to "soup.a" which

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,080
gives me this "a" tag here because this always

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,990
gives us the first occurrence of a particular tag.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,670
So we have "link" is equals to "soup.a".

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,670
And if I print "link",

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,970
You can see it gives me the first "a" tag I have.

26
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:48,810
So this one. "id" is equals to "link1", so you can see the match.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,350
So if I say "link.parents",

28
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,660
it says it returns us a generator object.

29
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,660
It says "generator object parents at"

30
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,640
this address.

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:13,830
And if I use "link.parent", it returns me the "story",

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:13,830
this "p" tag which has its "class='story'". So

33
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,860
let's just use ".name". So the direct parent of the

34
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,860
"a" tag is this "p" tag, you can see that here.

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,890
I wrote "link.parent.name".

36
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,390
So now what are we going to do is we are going to iterate

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,730
for this parents of this "a" tag and who are they.

38
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:45,090
So I say "for parents in link.parents", I say print

39
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:45,090
"parent". So this "parent" gives me the tag and if I print

40
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,660
this it is going to give me the whole values

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,640
for these tags which would be like

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,640
printing basically the whole document.

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,920
So I'm going to say "parent.name".

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,480
I hope you remember the ".name" method returns

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,480
the name of a particular tag. If I run this now,

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,220
you see it gives us the first parent which

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,220
is the "p" tag because this "a" tag has the

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,600
"p" tag as its parent and then this "p" tag

49
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,600
has this "body" tag as this parent.

50
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,840
You can see that here.

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,550
And then this "body" tag has "html" as its parent, you can

52
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,550
see that here. And then "html" has a document or Beautiful

53
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:33,930
Soup as its parent. So the ".parents" method returns

54
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:33,930
us a generator which is a list of all the

55
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:42,030
parents we have for that particular tag will ring

56
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:42,030
till we reach the Beautiful Soup or the document object

57
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:50,930
in our parse tree. I hope this is clear.

58
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:50,930
In the next videos, we would be moving sideways

59
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:58,010
in our parse tree. We have covered how we can move

60
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:58,010
down our parse tree like if I'm at the document or if I am

61
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:06,320
at this "html" tag, how can I access any of this "a" tag

62
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:06,320
or this "p" tag or any other tags, we've done that

63
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,970
and we've also discussed how we can move up our parse tree.

64
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:16,550
I was at this "a" tag and I wanted to move to

65
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:16,550
this body tag, how can I do that.

66
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:24,150
We can move through our parents using this ".parents"

67
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:24,150
method and then we can do whatever we want

68
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,270
to while moving

69
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,800
through them and we can manipulate the tags or we could get the data.

70
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,350
I mean we can do whatever we want with them this way.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,730
And now we're going to discuss how we can move sideways in the parse tree.

72
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,970
Thank you very much.
