Hello everyone! In this section we're going to learn

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:08,810
how to navigate through our Beautiful Soup to access

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,690
different tags. Ok, so I have this HTML file here.

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,130
You can see it has the same structure,

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,260
I mean like the very basic one. It has a "head",

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:32,300
it has a "body" and in its "body" it has "b" tags like

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:32,300
this "b" tag first and then it has this "p" tag,

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:40,890
then another one and then another one. So there, basically,

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:40,890
body has four children and this "p" tag further

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,140
has three children which are "a" tags.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,550
And if you consider navigable strings then there are more than four.

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,060
So how do we access these tags individually.

13
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,930
We're going to discuss this in this section.

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,930
So one of the very simple ways to do this

15
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:12,270
is that what we do is we use direct tag names

16
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:12,270
and access that tag through their names.

17
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,880
Right now I have written a very simple code which

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,880
reads this file and it returns me back this

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,230
file and then I have a soup of this file.

20
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:32,120
So if I pretty print it, I say "soup.prettify",

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:32,120
it gives me this tree. Exact this tree.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:39,930
This is HTML tree. OK, so now let's

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:39,930
say I want to access this "title" tag.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,590
So what can I do is.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
I can say "title" is equals to "soup.title".

26
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,930
And if I print "title" now, we get "title" tag.

27
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,720
So this is a very simple way how we can access

28
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,720
any tag data directly through their tag names.

29
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,980
But the problem here is:

30
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,980
let's say I want to access this second "p" tag.

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,150
What will I do now.

32
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:15,630
I mean if I write "p" is equals to "soup.p".

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,910
If I print it,

34
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:29,590
it gives me the first "p" I have which says its

35
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:29,590
class is "title" but I want the "p" where the

36
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,300
class is "story".

37
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,240
This one here. I want the second

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,240
"p" tag, not the first one.

39
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:46,240
So the flow this method has is that it only gives me

40
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:46,240
the first available tag with this name.

41
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,160
So it gives me the first "p" tag

42
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,370
i comes across in my tree, which is this one.

43
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,110
So it gives us this "p" tag.

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,910
But as I wanted this one I have to consider some other

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,910
ways to get to this "p" tag. I can't do this

46
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,830
directly accessing the "p" tag name.

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:17,610
So in our future videos, what we are going to do is we are going

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:17,610
to learn how we can navigate through a tree like this and

49
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,290
move down our tree, accessing

50
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,290
different elements or different tags.

51
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,190
In our case like as we discussed this scenario, the second

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,190
"p" tag, how we can access these tags and

53
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,350
how we move through them.

54
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,510
Thank you very much.
