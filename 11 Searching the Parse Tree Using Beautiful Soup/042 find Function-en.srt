Hello everyone! In the last video, we discussed the

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:07,000
parameters of "find_all" function and we

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,210
completed all the parameters we can send to

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,210
"find_all" function to refine our search.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,280
In this video, we are going to discuss the "find" function.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,870
It is the same as the "find_all" function.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,370
I mean it takes the same arguments as you can see

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,370
here, the "name", the attributes, "recursive", "string"

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:30,880
and keyword arguments but the one argument that

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:30,880
is missing here is the "limit" argument if you

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,430
remember. "limit" is the argument which in "find_all"

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,430
function limites the number of searches it also returns.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,920
So what's the difference between "find" and "find_all"?

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,920
"find" only returns a single object if it finds

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,720
any, it doesn't return more than one.

16
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,830
I mean if there are more than one. Let's say we

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,830
are searching for "a" tags using "find".

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,290
So if there are let's say 5 "a" tags, it only returns

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,290
us the first "a" tag, not the whole list of "a" tags. So

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,290
"limit" is of no use here.

21
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:10,370
"find" only returns us a single object. "limit" was

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:10,370
used to limit the number of search results returned and "find" here

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,020
only returns one, so it doesn't make sense to have a limit argument here.

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,010
So the signature for the "find" function is same as you can see here.

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,960
It's the same as "find_all" except for the "limit", we don't have a limit here.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,600
I'm just going to give you an example.

27
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,670
We're going to use the same HTML document here.

28
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,330
So you can see let's say I have

29
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:38,950
three "a" tags. I'm going to call this find function on "a".

30
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,310
And let's see what happens.

31
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,290
And if I call this, it only returns me one "a" tag, the first one precisely.

32
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:59,090
If you see this here. So it only returns us

33
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:59,090
the first "a" tag, it doesn't return us

34
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:06,690
all "a" tags and if I change this to "find_all", you

35
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:06,690
can see ir returns me a list of "a" tags which are

36
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,760
three in number.

37
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,250
I mean I could say "len(tag)"

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,640
and you can see this three.

39
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,380
So ir returns three tags

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,100
if we use "find_all" but when we use

41
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,270
"find" it only returns us one.

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,100
So the difference between "find" and "find_all" is

43
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,100
that "find" only returns us one single object if it finds

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,620
any.

45
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,250
And in case of multiple objects it only returns us the first

46
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,250
object it finds and "find_all" what it does is that

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,400
it returns us the whole list of objects it finds in the whole parse tree.

48
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,670
So this is a difference between "find" and "find_all". In the next

49
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,490
video, we are going to discuss a live example of how to scrap from a life site

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,510
and I'll show you how we can apply these techniques, how we apply these techniques

51
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,470
to parse a real HTML tree of a website.

52
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,510
And see you soon.

53
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,590
Thank you very much.
