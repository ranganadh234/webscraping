00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,730
Hello everyone! In this section, we are going to discuss

2
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,730
Selenium and how we can use it to interact with our browsers.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,700
So before I get into what is Selenium

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,700
and the why do we need Selenium,

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,030
I need you to understand two technologies which are widely used in the web.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:26,380
One is JavaScript and the other is Ajax. So JavaScript and

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:26,380
Ajax, so Ajax stands "Asynchoronous JavaScript and XML".

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:32,950
I'm sure all of you must have heard of these technologies before.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,150
And I'll just briefly explain what each technology is and

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,150
what problem they pose when they're scraping data

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,600
from websites.

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,670
OK so if you remember I have this Coding Bat

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,670
opened here and that section is "Warmup-1".

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,590
OK.

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,040
We opened Coding Bat in the project 1.

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:01:00,230
So I'm going to open this question here and you can see that

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:01:00,230
here I have the question statement and then I have

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,890
the examples for this question.

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,880
So what I want you to do is I wat you to scrape the solution

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,880
for this question which, if I click this button,

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,330
is here.

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:19,080
So when I say "Inspect Element" and I see that OK this

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:19,080
is a "div" which has the id "result", it contains the

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,120
solution so it should be fairly easy to get.

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,040
I mean that I could just get to this "div"

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,040
because it has a ID and ID is unique.

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,030
All I have to do is have to search for a "div" which has its ID "results".

28
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:39,750
So I give you URL of this question and

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:39,750
you're supposed to scrape the solution for this question.

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,840
Can you do that?

31
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,180
Using requests.

32
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,670
Can you do that? Apparently, right,

33
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,380
you can say that "yes, you can do that"

34
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,380
but I'll just show you why that is not possible.

35
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:51,800
OK.

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,300
I'm going just to reload this.

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,100
And now here we are.

38
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,430
This is the page.

39
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,350
This is the response you get when

40
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,350
you send a request to this URL.

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,760
So and use "Inspect Element" here and you can see that

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,760
I have the div ID here "results" but it contains

43
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,570
nothing, absolutely nothing.

44
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,290
How are you going to get your result now?

45
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,400
You're going to get this web page or this HTML which is here right now.

46
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,570
When you open this URL.

47
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,210
But I want a solution for this.

48
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,500
I want a solution for this question and I can't get it

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,890
unless click this button. As soon as I click this button I get the solution.

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,720
And you can see that my "div" is now populated.

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,140
It is not empty.

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
It contains some elements.

53
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,930
And then navigable strings.

54
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,270
So what happened?

55
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:51,790
I click this button and then the content of the "div"

56
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:51,790
changes but when I send a request to the server

57
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,190
it returns me an empty "div" which had this ID "result".

58
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,630
That is an empty "div".

59
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,060
So how do I scrape the solution for this question here.

60
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,940
How do I do that?

61
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,980
I mean I can't actually click the button with that HTMl.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,290
You can't do that so I can't do that.

63
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,900
That is not possible and this

64
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,570
is the same

65
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,740
URL we use.

66
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,530
So what this means is that when I click this button,

67
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,530
my page is not reloading or it is not sending

68
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,360
another request to the server.

69
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,810
This is only happening at our site, only at the

70
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,810
web browser site, only my HTML content changing

71
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,940
and no request is being sent to the server.

72
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,480
So what is going on and how can we tackle this?

73
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,360
I mean if I want to scrape the solution for this, I

74
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,360
can't do that with request. Can we do that?

75
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,640
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

76
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,910
I have to know some way to interact with my webpage

77
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,910
so that I can click this "Show Solution"

78
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:55,920
button or let's say that I want you to search for something on Google.

79
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:04,580
So if you open Google, I want you to search for let's say my name.

80
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,440
How are you going to do that?

81
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,650
Can you type my name in using requests,

82
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,950
can you do that?

83
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,180
If you keep it simple.

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:22,220
You can do that if we keep it simple. You can do this, you

85
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:22,220
can search like this using requests if you

86
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,830
keep it simple so.

87
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,950
But for this case here, this JavaScript case here

88
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,950
I'm afraid you can't do anything about this.

89
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,010
You can't do anything about this.

90
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:38,180
OK, so right now here I have this Instagram open

91
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:38,180
here so you can see that here asks for me

92
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,780
to sign up.

93
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,220
I'm just giving you an example of JavaScript

94
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,220
and what is the problem it poses

95
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:52,280
when they're scraping data so you can see that I

96
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:52,280
need to sign up here and if I want

97
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,170
to sign in, I have, it says "have an account?" and log in.

98
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:03,320
So as soon as I click log in it should give me a username an ID password fields.

99
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,840
So just see carefully, does my page reload?

100
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,660
I mean does your URL changes or something when I click log in?

101
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,410
Or is this just happening?

102
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,430
This is just happening using JavaScript.

103
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:25,060
Did you see that my page did not reload as soon

104
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:25,060
as I clicked log in my page did not reload.

105
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,560
What does this mean.

106
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,870
This means that JavaScript is being used here.

107
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:37,890
JavaScript is being used here to access, to modify

108
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:37,890
the content, to modify the HTML of this page

109
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,960
without sending a request to server.

110
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:48,780
So I'm just going to show you something and then

111
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:48,780
I'll explain to you the next technology I mentioned,

112
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,090
Ajax.

113
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,330
OK so this is open here and it contains my news feed.

114
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,600
I mean this is my news feed.

115
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,500
OK.

116
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,840
So you can see that the scroll bar here and

117
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:10,940
I can only move it here and you can see

118
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:10,940
that right now there are no more photos after this.

119
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:18,420
But as soon as I get to them, many of them

120
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:18,420
like new photos appear like how is

121
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,200
that happening.

122
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,230
There weren't there in the HTML.

123
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,310
You see that again. OK.

124
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,070
Just to see it slowly.

125
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,600
I'm going to go slowly now.

126
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,940
Did you see that? How is this happening.

127
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,350
I mean there weren't there in the first place.

128
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,920
How is this happening, how are they loading again.

129
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,910
I mean my URL remains the same, it is same, nothing is going

130
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,910
wrong with then, how is this happening?

131
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,360
My page is not reloading.

132
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,250
And this is not javascript because I mean you

133
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,250
can't have that much photos here there.

134
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,130
I mean my news feed is refreshing.

135
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:00,890
So AJAX is that you send a request to server but

136
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:00,890
we don't actually reload your whole page.

137
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,840
So this news feed here is working the same way.

138
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,360
You see this.

139
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,450
This is working the same way.

140
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,190
It's the same way.

141
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:18,960
I mean like it is using AJAX to only change some

142
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:18,960
content of my HTML page here which is our news

143
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,250
feed stories here.

144
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,430
So this is Ajax and if I said I wanted you to scrape

145
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,430
something like I wanted you to scrape the names

146
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,560
of this, all the caption or something. How would you have done that?

147
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,300
I mean if I say I want you to scrape them like a whole news feed.

148
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,720
How would you do that

149
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,600
As soon as you open your Instagram, like your scroll bar.

150
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,300
That's like you can see only this much.

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,630
But as soon as I move down

152
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,460
you see it loads photos.

153
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,020
So if I open this with Beautiful Soup, I can do this.

154
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,100
I can do this if I parse it Beautiful Soup. I can

155
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,100
do this because I don't have access to all of my

156
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,160
photos here because they have not been loaded.

157
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,030
There are not in HTML.

158
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,020
So do how do I handle this? These problems

159
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:19,710
require some other way of thinking, there require some other way for us to interact

160
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,700
with their webpages so that we can actually

161
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,700
interact with the HTML in the server sends us

162
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,920
and parse it later on according to our wishes like

163
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,920
a want to be able to click this button but I

164
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,890
can't do that using requests.

165
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,920
Unfortunately I can't do that.

166
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,600
So the solution here is Selenium.

167
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:46,470
There this module Selenium which is used for

168
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:46,470
this purpose. Iit is basically a tool for automating

169
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,580
that applications.

170
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,990
But as this goes as far for web scraping that only going

171
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,990
to stick to that very basic stuff and how it can

172
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:03,440
help us scrape web pages which use these technologies

173
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:03,440
JavaScript and Ajax. In the next video, I'm going to

174
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:12,170
show you how to set up Selenium and how we can

175
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:12,170
actually like how we use Selenium to open web pages

176
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,110
and interact with them, just a very basic introductory video.

177
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,840
And then the later videos, we'll move on and see how we

178
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,840
select elements and all that stuff and how to

179
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,800
click buttons and write texts in our websites using Selenium.

180
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,520
I hope this is clear to you now and see you in the next video.

181
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,420
Thank you.
