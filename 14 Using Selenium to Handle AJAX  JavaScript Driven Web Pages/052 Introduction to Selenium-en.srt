00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,290
Hello everyone! In this video, we're going to talk about

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,290
Selenium and how we can use it with Python. In the

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,010
previous video,

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,810
we discussed JavaScript, Ajax and the need for Selenium.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:21,780
So from what we know right now, Selenium is another

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:21,780
way of opening web pages and interacting with them.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:30,280
So let's see what Selenium does and how actually does

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:30,280
it interact with web pages and how we can open

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,330
web pages using Selenium.

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,330
So at line number one, this is a necessary import

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,140
you need to do, "from selenium import web driver".

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,110
After doing that in my installation video you'll see that

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,110
I have shown you, you have to download the Chrome

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,050
driver for Selenium.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:57,000
So wherever you have the Chrome driver in your system,

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:57,000
just copy that path. Like for my system the path is here,

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,490
I have it in my "Downloads" folder.

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:05,430
So it is right here, the Chrome driver, that's in my

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:05,430
"Downloads" folder. I've just copied the path and it is here

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,070
in my system.

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,470
What do you have to do is you have to see what's the path for your system.

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:22,350
After doing that, we are going to create a driver object.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:22,350
We say "driver" is equals to "webdriver.chrome" and here I'm going

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,840
to copy this path and send it as a parameter.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,850
OK, so now I have a driver object, that driver object.

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,250
So what is that webdriver object. You can think of it

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,250
as a complete browser, like I have a complete Chrome

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:47,450
browser which I can programmatically control,

29
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:47,450
I can actually control this Chrome browser programmatically.

30
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:54,190
I can actually control with clicks and

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:54,190
stuff, actually moving my cursor or doing

32
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,290
something, I'm going to control it with my code.

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,020
So as soon as you make a driver object, you need to

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,020
realize that this will open an instance of Chrome.

35
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,900
So what do you need to do now is you need to make

36
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,900
sure that when your program ends you need to close

37
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,370
that instance.

38
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:20,110
So I'm going to say "driver.close" this will

39
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:20,110
quit the Chrome application which is being

40
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:26,620
launched at line number eight and I'm going to run this

41
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:26,620
now and I'm going to show you what's going on and how this is

42
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,150
going on.

43
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,510
Can you see this?

44
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,170
It was really quick.

45
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:43,100
Maybe I'll use time to have some sleep so that

46
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:43,100
after opening, my program sleeps for let's say

47
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,350
five seconds so that we actually know that

48
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,350
the Chrome browser opened. I think five is good.

49
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,750
OK.

50
00:02:48,770 --> 00:03:00,160
I'm going to run this now. Ok, can you see

51
00:02:48,770 --> 00:03:00,160
this here? And it automatically quits.

52
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,090
So I can have a print statement here before "sleep".

53
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,920
Print "after sleep".

54
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,170
So "before sleep".

55
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,260
And here we go.

56
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:28,400
So this basically opens a Chrome browser, a complete

57
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:28,400
Chrome browser, and it can do whatever I want with

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,870
that

59
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,340
with that browser, with that window I have opened.

60
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:39,110
So the most basic thing that we need to do right now

61
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:39,110
is we need to open some page and see how that works

62
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,640
out.

63
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,750
So we say the method is "get" method. Here

64
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,750
I'm going to input the URL for Google

65
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,090
and then I'm going to use sleep for five

66
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,090
seconds so that I can see that Google is open.

67
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:02,740
OK, and I'm going to run this and then going to see if

68
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:02,740
we have Google opened, the Chrome instance, which

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,310
we create at line number eight. Let's run this

70
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:18,420
here.

71
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,110
So it actually opens a Google window.

72
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,380
I can change to anything. I could have it

73
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,380
to Facebook. I'm going to run this now.

74
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,510
You can see that here.

75
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:42,610
So you can see. So I have a Chrome window which opens a Facebook page.

76
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,660
So the method is "get" method and the parameter

77
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,660
required is the URL and these are the parameters.

78
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,860
OK.

79
00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:02,340
So what we have seen right now is we have

80
00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:02,340
learned how to open a Selenium web driver and

81
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,070
for these videos, we are using Chrome driver for doing this.

82
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,920
And we have learned that whenever we open

83
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,920
an instance of Chrome we need to close it.

84
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,940
So that's why we have this "driver.close" statement.

85
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,470
And if we need to open some web page we use the "driver.get" method.

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,980
This opens the required web page. And let's

87
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,980
say I want to get the HTML for that page.

88
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
How do I do that?

89
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,900
So first of all, I'm going to make a soup out of this

90
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,590
Facebook's HTML. I say "BeautifulSoup".

91
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,880
And now what I'm going to do.

92
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,940
What I'm going to do is I'm to say "soup" is equal to "BeautifulSoup".

93
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:49,210
Now I'm to say "driver.page_source".

94
00:05:49,390 --> 00:06:00,230
This is going to give me the HTML for

95
00:05:49,390 --> 00:06:00,230
Facebook page and I'm going to remove the

96
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,320
"sleep" here because I we only want to get the

97
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,320
HTML right now and see if it works or not.

98
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:14,680
And how this is actually going on.

99
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:22,740
So you can see that I have the Facebook's HTML here, you

100
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:22,740
can see this here, "html class", "id='facebook'", language

101
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,010
English and all that.

102
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:33,030
So this is how we get the HTML in for whatever page we

103
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:33,030
have opened on the web driver. The method is

104
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,830
"driver.page_source".

105
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,090
Sorry this

106
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,180
is a ".page_source".

107
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,440
So now this is how we can make a soup out of the

108
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,440
web page we have opened and using Selenium.

109
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,520
So previously we used Beautiful Soup with requests

110
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,520
and now we've seen how we can use Selenium instead of

111
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:03,430
request to open some page and in the future we are

112
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:03,430
going to see how we can interact with the elements

113
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,350
that are present on the web page and programmatically

114
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,350
control then and control the flow and elements of

115
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:16,210
our program and the browser and how this is going to work out.

116
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,740
I hope now you understand how this works.

117
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,500
I'll see in the next video, we'll

118
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,500
discuss more Selenium. Thank you.
