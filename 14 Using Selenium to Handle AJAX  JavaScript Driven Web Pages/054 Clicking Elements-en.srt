00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,350
Hello everyone! In this video, we're going to learn

2
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,350
another way to interact with the elements present in

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,330
the Selenium web page.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,020
So now here we have this log in button or a link.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,350
And if I click it I get the log in window. So

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,350
JavaScript actively changes this part here.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,610
So how is this happening?

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,000
I mean I click log in.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,690
I get this.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,450
So the page is not really loading it is

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,450
only JavaScript and this is like a button.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,220
So like as soon as I click it again, this changes.

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,000
So how do I make this happen?

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,910
We're going to see right now how we can do this.

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,340
So I'm going to see the HTML for this here.

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:52,110
And I can see that this is basically an "a" tag which has an

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:52,110
"href" to a JavaScript function and the text for this

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,860
is "Log in".

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,810
So the document I shared for selecting different

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,810
elements with Selenium One. way is to select an

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,580
element using its links text.

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,560
So this "a" tag is a link and the text here is "Log in".

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,500
Let's see how we can make this work and

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,500
select this element and then interact with it.

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,820
OK, so I've opened "Instagram.com".

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,040
You can see it, this is a very basic setup we have.

27
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,850
OK, I've opened it.

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,950
I made a driver object, a web driver object.

29
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,500
Sorry.

30
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,140
Then I opened this "Instragram.com".

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,930
Then I've closed the driver.

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,710
OK.

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,850
So now the thing we want to do is you want to get this

34
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,850
element here or get this tag here and then you

35
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,940
want to be able to click this tag.

36
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,390
So what are you going to do.

37
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,280
I'm going to say

38
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,190
"login_button",

39
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:03,730
"driver.find_element_by_link_text" and then copy

40
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:03,730
the link text which is here, that is "Log in".

41
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,820
So now I have the "login_button".

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,030
Now I have the "login_button".

43
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:17,880
So I can say "login_button.click" and this is

44
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:17,880
actually going to click this "Log in" button.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,760
And when I do this you can see that this window opens.

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,560
OK.

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,100
Let's see if we can make this work and I'm going

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,100
to say "sleep" for five seconds and I'm going to put some

49
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,190
more here too so that we can actually see this happen.

50
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:33,700
OK.

51
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,310
I'm going to run this now and let's see how this works.

52
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,420
OK, so here we go with insta

53
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,500
where we used five seconds of sleep.

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:57,870
Did you see that? Actually click that

55
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:57,870
"Log in" button or link so like this.

56
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:05,120
Right now we learned another method to which we can

57
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:05,120
interact with the elements listed on a web page in

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,110
Selenium.

59
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,400
That is this "click" method.

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,160
So if it's a button or a link we could we can actually click

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,160
it by selecting that element and then using

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,590
"login_button.click".

63
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:23,840
I hope up to now this is clear to you. In the next video,

64
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:23,840
we are going to discuss XPath. I'm going to give you

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,750
a very brief introduction to what XPath is that how we

66
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,750
can write XPath expressions, the rest of that

67
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,930
file and we can get to it then.

68
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:39,380
Then I hope this is clear to you and I want you

69
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:39,380
to play around with Selenium, I want you to select

70
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,510
different elements, open different pages.

71
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,810
See how you can play around with this,

72
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,810
search on Google, automate something, log

73
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,360
into your Facebook account or log in on the

74
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,360
Instagram account or something using Selenium.

75
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,760
Just try this out play with that.

76
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,900
Thank you very much everyone.

77
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,230
See you in the next video.
