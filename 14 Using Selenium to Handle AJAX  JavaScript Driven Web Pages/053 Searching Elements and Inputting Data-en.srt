00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:07,630
Hello everyone! In this video, we are going to discuss how

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:07,630
we can interact with the elements that are present on

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,300
the page using Selenium.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,120
So let's say I have opened Google here.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,320
So if you use request and you

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,320
open Google you get this page here.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,180
But what I want to actually do is I want to

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,180
search for something by inputting

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,600
something in this text bar and then saying Google search.

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,600
I'm want to do something like this but how can I

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,950
do it?

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,250
So one way is that we're going to use Selenium for this job.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,850
So how do we do with this?

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,830
So this is a textfield and what Selenium is going to do

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,830
is it is going to open this page and then going

16
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,830
to ask it to search for this text field here

17
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,830
and I am just going to use "Inspect Element".

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,800
And let's see if we can locate this textfield, this "input" tag.

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,310
So this "input" tag has id "lst-ib", if you can see that here.

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,290
So I mean an id is something that is unique.

21
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,480
So we can access this "input" tag.

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,060
And then

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,990
what we are going to do is

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:15,300
we are going to write something down using Selenium

25
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:15,300
and then we'll do a google search using Selenium.

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,100
This is what I've decided for this video.

27
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,820
And let's get on with it now.

28
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,290
OK.

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,370
So here we are.

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,280
This is the basic setup we have, I made a driver object of Selenium.

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,040
OK.

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,120
And then I've also closed it.

33
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,230
Now what I want to do is I want to be able to search

34
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,230
text field here so that I can input some value

35
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,710
in this.

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,010
So as we have the id for this, I say "search_bar" is equals to "driver".

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,620
Now I say "find_element_by_id". There are different

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,620
ways that you can find elements using Selenium.

39
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,960
So you can see that one of them is by ID, then

40
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,960
one of then is by class name and css selectors,

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,040
link_text, element by name.

42
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,490
I'll have a reference document and you can

43
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,490
actually see which suits you better and you

44
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,640
can do it there.

45
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,650
So I'm going to show you right now how to do this by ID.

46
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,900
So I say "driver.find_element_by_id" and here

47
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,900
I'm going to input this ID for this "input" tag.

48
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,790
So the id is this

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,910
and OK, now my search bar is actually this text here we can see.

50
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,050
Now I want to send some value to this.

51
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,980
Like I want to input some value.

52
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,630
What do I do now?

53
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,990
Now this has another method.

54
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:49,870
It's a "search_bar.send_keys" method. Let's say

55
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:49,870
I'm going to write "I want to learn web scraping".

56
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,750
OK, so now what search bar is doing

57
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,750
is if I'm saying "search_bar.send_keys"

58
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:04,910
"I want to learn web scraping" this is going

59
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:04,910
to write this text in this field here. We are going

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,480
to see how this is happening

61
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,600
but, this is the method which

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,600
does this ".send_keys" method.

63
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,280
OK, so now as you know that this "input" tag

64
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,280
is basically inside and under there "form" tag.

65
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,020
That is how you input some data.

66
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,450
And data is sent to

67
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,830
server back as a request.

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,300
So mostly websites use forms for this.

69
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,630
And similarly we have a "form", we have a form

70
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,630
here which is the parent of this "input"

71
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:35,950
tag.

72
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:42,270
And if we actually want to search for something

73
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:42,270
what we're doing is we are submitting that form.

74
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,020
So where is that form.

75
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:53,010
Let's see but one other thing to note here is

76
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:53,010
that you see like this is the form here.

77
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,010
This is the form it contains these two buttons

78
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,360
and this "textfield".

79
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,970
If I get to this tag here, it is the closing braces

80
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,900
I mean there's the closing tag for "form".

81
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,440
So this is the "form" here.

82
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:11,330
And as soon as you press Enter or you press

83
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:11,330
Google search what that means is "OK, I'm

84
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,520
submitting my form. I've written and what I

85
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,520
wanted to know and now I want to search Google".

86
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,280
By submitting a "form" you mean that

87
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,910
OK, now you are actually submitting that

88
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,910
data you have input back to the server

89
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,670
and then server is going to send you another response back.

90
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,860
So how do we submit a "form" using Selenium.

91
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:39,680
One way could be that I could search this

92
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:39,680
"button" and I could use another

93
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,830
method which is going to search Google.

94
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,720
I mean it's going to click this button but we'll do

95
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,720
that in the next video. For right now, we can see

96
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,050
how we can automatically submit the form of this "input" tag.

97
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,750
So how do we do that

98
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:01,110
is there is a method it says "search_bar.submit".

99
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:01,110
It is going to submit the form, the search

100
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,440
bar.

101
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,580
This method is going to submit the form

102
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,580
in which this "input" tags is enclosed.

103
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:12,720
So this "input" tag here, this one here, it is enclosed

104
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:12,720
in this form so it is automatically going to submit

105
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,370
this form and when they call the submit method and

106
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,370
then I'm going to remove this "sleep" here

107
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,270
so that we can actually see that.

108
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,460
OK, did it even work or not.

109
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,880
So let's see how this goes and I'm going to run it

110
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,080
now.

111
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:39,980
So you see I have Google here.

112
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,140
I didn't do anything, I didn't write anything.

113
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,750
I assure you of that.

114
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,800
So this is like it automatically did this

115
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,800
it wrote that and it submitted the form.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,660
And it's closed now because we had "sleep" for 10 seconds.

117
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,450
So I hope that this is clear to you.

118
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,690
We discussed searching tags or elements.

119
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,050
There are different ways we can search tags or elements

120
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,050
and I'll provide a document you can make. It's

121
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,900
a little kind of cheat sheet.

122
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,660
You can actually look at it and see how this works.

123
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,680
So you can train with yourself and learn how to do that.

124
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,130
And then we learned the "send_keys" method with which

125
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,130
we can input data into a text field or "input" tags

126
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,370
and then we learn how we can submit a form. In the

127
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,370
next video, we are going to learn how to click a button and some

128
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:34,640
other things using Selenium and then we'll move on to

129
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:34,640
some different things which we can do with Selenium.

130
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,380
Thank you very much.

131
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,680
I hope this is clear to you.
