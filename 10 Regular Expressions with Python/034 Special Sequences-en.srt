Hello everyone! In the last video, we discussed the

2
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:07,320
"compile" function and character classes and we also

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,450
went over through the "match" function and how we

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,450
can match RegEX expressions using the "match" function.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,850
Ok, so in this video, we are going to discuss

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,850
special sequences especially sequences

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,780
that are commonly used character classes and

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,780
we can just use these special sequences instead

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,040
of writing those character classes.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,880
I will just quickly go through the

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,880
sequences and I would like you to play

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,040
with this code and experiment with this yourself and see how it works.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,180
So here the first special sequence is this "\d".

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,480
This matches any decimal digit and is equal to this

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,260
character class, like 0 to 9 range.

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,980
So this capital "D" matches any non-digit character.

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,210
So that's the complement of this character class.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:06,650
So this "\s" matches any whitespace

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:06,650
character like tabs, new line, spaces.

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,390
And similarly this is a complement, the capital S..

21
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,750
And then I have a "\w". This matches any

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,750
alphanumeric character and

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,100
the character class for this

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,810
is this like, "a" to "z"

25
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,550
lowercase,

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,310
and then "A" to "Z" uppercase, and 0 to 9 range of

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,310
any numbers. And then this here is the complement of

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,550
this set here.

29
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,190
So I would like you to play with this and

30
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,190
experiment with this yourself and see how it works.

31
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,030
And I hope you'll understand better

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,030
then and how character classes work.

33
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:51,750
Next, we'll discuss more about RegEX and I'll

34
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:51,750
discuss how we can repeat different characters

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:00,030
and we'll go through this in the next video on how we

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:00,030
can repeat stuff and write more powerful RegEX

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,370
expressions.

38
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,330
Thank you very much.
