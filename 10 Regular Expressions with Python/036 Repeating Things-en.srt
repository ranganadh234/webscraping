Hello everyone! In the last video, we discussed the

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,250
asterisk character which specifies that the

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:15,100
previous character which occurs before it, can be matched

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:15,100
zero or infinite times. In this video, we are going to discuss

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,520
this plus character which specifies the previous

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,520
character can be matched one or more times. So

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,060
the difference from a asterisk is that asterisk says zero to infinity.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,930
And plus says one to infinity.

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,600
I'm just going to give a quick example here.

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,990
So let's say I have this and if I run this.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,890
I say print "regex.match" and then have an empty string here.

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:58,410
So this will give me a match because asterisk says

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:58,410
that "a" can either come 0 times or as many times as

14
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,330
it wants to.

15
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:08,200
But if I have this here, this is going to give me "None",

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:08,200
it doesn't give me a match because plus says that it

17
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,770
should at least come once.

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:17,770
So if I have "a" once here, it gives me a match

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:17,770
and then I can have "a" as many times I want.

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,080
So I have a match. OK.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:30,690
So now same as before, we can use this with character classes, I could say "a" to

22
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,760
"c" and "+".

23
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,830
I can have any string here.

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,950
"abcabcabc".

25
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,350
It gives me a match.

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:52,540
But if I have an empty string here, it gives me

27
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:52,540
"None" because plus says that this character,

28
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,140
character class,

29
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,490
should come at least once.

30
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,490
If I have a asterisk here,

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,790
it would give me a match.

32
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,660
So this is the difference between plus and asterisk

33
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,660
and I hope this is clear to you.

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,950
So in the next video, we'll discuss one more "repeating

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,950
things" character and I hope that this is clear to you.

36
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,480
The difference between asterisk and plus. This

37
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,480
is a very common mistake most programmers

38
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,160
make.

39
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,610
So I just want this to be clear to you.

40
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,320
OK.

41
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,060
So thank you very much.

42
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,350
See you in the next video.
