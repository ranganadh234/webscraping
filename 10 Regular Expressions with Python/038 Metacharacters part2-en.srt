Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,610
This is the last video we are going to have on Regular Expressions.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,000
And in this I'm just making you are more

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,000
familiar with some more metacharacters.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,640
I want you to play around with them and experiment with them

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,640
yourself, I'm just going to explain what they do and

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,810
never do any basic expressions using them.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,640
OK, so the first is this hat character.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,950
I mean these are the most commonly used

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,950
metacharacters. There are more

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,430
and if you're interested you can look them.

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,430
I can have them in a Word document if you want.

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,830
OK, so the first one is this hat character.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,090
What this does is

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,220
this say that this string should start with

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,190
this character

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,210
Let's say I have this "^a".

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
This means that my string should start with "a".

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,740
OK, so this pipe character is the "or" operator.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,740
I've written this expression here.

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,170
This means that the string should have either A or B OK.

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,690
And then I have this dollar character.

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,690
It says that it matches at the end of line.

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,300
If I wanted to match this string using this expression,

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,300
that would mean that that string should end

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,150
with "c". That's definite, that string should end with "c".

27
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,680
Ok, so I just want you to play around with it and I

28
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,680
hope you're more familiar with Regular Expressions

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,440
and are able to write Regular Expressions. Next

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,300
we are going to move on to searching our Beautiful Soup parse tree.

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,610
And we'll use Regular Expressions while searching through tags and classes.

32
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:50,250
So, OK I think I'll see you in the next video and I

33
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:50,250
hope that you understand Regular Expressions

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,130
better now.

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,880
Thank you.
