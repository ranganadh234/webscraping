Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,020
Last time we discussed list comprehensions. Today in

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,020
this lecture, we're going to discuss inline "if

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:16,250
else" statements. In Python, we have this feature

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:16,250
where we can write an "if" statement in a single line.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,060
And it's very handy.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,570
I'm just going to walk you through this very quickly.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,570
Let's have this variable, it has a value 20 in it.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,230
So normally I would use an "if" statement,

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,230
if "a" is equal to 20 print "a is 20"

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:32,820
else

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,870
print "a is not 20".

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:40,260
So if run this, it says "a is 20".

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:40,260
So how can I do this in a single line.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:55,450
So one way to do this is we say

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:55,450
print "a is 20" if here comes the condition,

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:02,020
else "a is not 20". So if I

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:02,020
run this, it says "a is 20".

19
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,570
And let's say I change it to 21 so

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,570
this should evaluate to false now.

21
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,220
If I run it, it says "a is not 20".

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,810
So how did I write this.

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,510
The syntax for this was that I'd do something here.

24
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,550
Then I write "if" condition and then

25
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,550
I say "else" and then do something.

26
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,800
So here in do something

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,590
what I was doing was I was writing a

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,590
string here that is 20 if condition else

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,380
and then I was doing something here.

30
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,860
So if I write 20 here, it evaluate true.

31
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:49,890
And we can also use it to let's say if "a" is 20 I

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:49,890
want to say that "b" is true else "b" is false.

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,660
So what I'll do is I'll say "b" is equal to "True"

34
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,320
if "a" is equal to 20 else "False".

35
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:10,260
So if I print "b", just going to comment this line,

36
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:10,260
if I print "b" it says "True" because it is 20.

37
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:17,880
OK, so inline "if else" statements are used

38
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:17,880
extensively in list comprehension. Let's say I have a list of numbers

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:30,260
"num" is equals to "value for value in range".

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,580
Now if I print this list, you'll see that

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,580
I have negative numbers and positive numbers.

42
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,570
Now I only want a list of positive numbers from this "num" list.

43
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,190
So what I can do is I can use list comprehension and

44
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,190
these inline "if else" statements to do this. So I say

45
00:02:48,190 --> 00:03:03,150
"positive_numbers" is equals to

46
00:02:48,190 --> 00:03:03,150
"value for value in num if value > 0".

47
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,550
And if I print "positive_num",

48
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,140
it only gives me positive values from this whole list.

49
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,730
And similarly I can do this for negative values.

50
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,080
So this is how you use inline "if else"

51
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,080
statements in list comprehensions and in general Python.

52
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:33,580
Next we'll move to how servers work and how the Websites are hosted on servers.

53
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,600
Thank you very much.

54
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,300
Have a nice day.
