<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/</a></p>

<p>However, it is up to you to use any Python editor you prefer.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Operating System</strong>
</h4>

<p>Any. Still, if you face any operating system related issue while installing packages, please send it to the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/web-scraping-with-python-beautifulsoup/learn/v4/questions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Q&amp;A</a> section of this course.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Internet Connection</strong></h4><p>Needless to say, web scraping requires Internet connection. However, there are no special requirements. Apparently, faster connection is better for large projects, but in this course, most exercises are not that big.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Instagram Account</strong></h4><p>This course has a project to log in and scrape images from your Instagram account. While it is generally okay to use your account for this one specific project, it is recommended to create a new account for such testing tasks.</p><h4><strong><br></strong></h4><h4><strong>Free Spreadsheets Software</strong></h4><p>As this course has some lectures about reading and writing to Excel files, you may like to have any free spreadsheet application just to check files. The bottom line is that  it is <strong>NOT</strong> required for the code to work, but if you just want to check files yourself, you can use any <em>free</em> software. This can be any open-source desktop application such as <em>OpenOffice</em> or <em>LibreOffice,</em> or even any free online service such as <em>Google Sheets</em>. Apparently, if you already have MS Excel application, it is okay, but is not required.<br></p><p><br></p><p>If you have any questions, please feel free to send them to the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/web-scraping-with-python-beautifulsoup/learn/v4/questions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Q&amp;A</a> section of this course.<br></p><p><br></p></p>
