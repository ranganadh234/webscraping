Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,740
In last video, we learned how to write an Excel file.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,490
So in this video, we are going to

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,490
learn how to read from an Excel file.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,800
So this was the file we wrote in the last video.

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,800
In this we have 200 rows and you can see in the first

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,010
column we have the string here. It says the row number

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,010
and in the second column we have the actual

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,300
number for the relevant rows.

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,820
Like for this it says 0, then 1, then 2 and

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,820
this goes on to 199. In total there are 200.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:31,940
OK.

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,580
So we'll be using "xlrd" module for reading

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:45,140
an Excel file. This is the import we use for reading from an Excel file.

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,480
Obviously there are many other ways you can

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,480
do this but we are only going to talk about

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,790
the most easy way and the one which is frequently

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,790
used which is sufficient for a user right now.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,680
OK.

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,710
So what we do is we open the workbook,

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:08,030
that's our first task. We say "xlrd.open_workbook". I give it the fileame.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,100
The filename is "first_file.xlsx".

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,090
I have opened the workbook like I want to read

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,090
from this so I give it the file, the path of that

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,230
file which is the name here.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,020
So this is goig to open the file here, "first_file.xlsx".

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,000
OK.

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,850
Now after doing that what we do is we select the

29
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,850
sheet from where we want to read. Here we only have

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,850
one sheet, so we are going to select this one.

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,590
But if we have multiple sheets,

32
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,590
we could specify the index there.

33
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:50,310
So I say "worksheet" is equals to

34
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:50,310
"workbook.sheet_by_index".

35
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,950
And then I say the first sheet

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,950
which is the zero sheet.

37
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,940
OK.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,720
Now that I have that, I want to

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,720
read the whole of this Excel file

40
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,210
so I need to know how many rows are

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,210
there in this Excel file. What can I do now?

42
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,290
There's a method here.

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,730
We can say it is like ".nrows".

44
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:20,610
And if I print it, "worksheet.nrows", it is

45
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:20,610
actually going to tell me the number

46
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,990
of rows in this Excel sheet.

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,260
It says 200.

48
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,550
And this is absolutely right.

49
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,940
I mean there are 200.

50
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,210
You can see that here. There are actually 200 rows here.

51
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:38,220
OK, so now what we do is we say "rows"

52
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:38,220
is equals to "worksheet.nrows".

53
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:45,740
Now what we are going do is we

54
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:45,740
are going to read each row and then we

55
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,750
are going to interpret the value or

56
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,750
we are going to print it right now.

57
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,740
And see how this works.

58
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,970
So I say "for row in

59
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,540
rows".

60
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,810
Now this method for worksheets,

61
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,810
the method is "row_values".

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,050
And then what it takes is the row number and it

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,050
returns a tuple of values, a tuple of different

64
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,430
values, the value of all the columns that are present there.

65
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,980
So I'm just going to show you

66
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,980
how this works so it will be more clear then.

67
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,840
OK.

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,450
Now we only have two columns here.

69
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,510
OK, the rest of them are blank.

70
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,740
So it is only going to returns us

71
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,740
a tuple of two values for each row.

72
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,800
The first value would be first column and

73
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,800
the second value would be the second column.

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:40,230
So I could say "first_column" and I could say

75
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:40,230
"second_column" is equals to "worksheet.row_values"

76
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,240
and then I say row and then I could say print "first_column"

77
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,140
and then give some space and then I say "second_column".

78
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,150
And let's see how this works.

79
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,200
I'm going to run this now.

80
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

81
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,990
Actually it should be "range" because "rows" is like 200.

82
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,920
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,120
That's my mistake.

84
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,560
OK, so you can see it here.

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,610
Now what it did was like I used a

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,610
loop which I run 200 times.

87
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,550
And each time it ran, what I did was

88
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,550
I use this "row_values" function.

89
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:26,870
This takes input as the number

90
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:26,870
of the roll with which we

91
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,480
want to get the values and then it returns me a tuple

92
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,480
of values of all the values that are present in that row.

93
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,020
So we only have two values here in each row.

94
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,070
So it is only going to return

95
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,070
us two values in our tuple.

96
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,650
OK.

97
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,570
So let's say first column and second column

98
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,570
and I get them. Then I'm just going to print them.

99
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,870
So this is how this works out and you can play

100
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,870
around with this module or you can create

101
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,990
your own Excel files and then you can

102
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,990
read from them and you can manipulate

103
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,990
them in different ways just to see how this works.

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,770
So I hope that this is clear to you now, how we can read Excel Files.

105
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,020
And if there are any queries, you can reach back.

106
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,920
Thank you very much.
