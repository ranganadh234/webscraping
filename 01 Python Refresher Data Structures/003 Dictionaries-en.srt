00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,270
Hello everyone! In the previous

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,130
lecture, we discussed list. In this lecture, we are going

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,130
to discuss another data structure which is commonly used in

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:16,240
Python. They are known as dictionaries. I'm

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:16,240
sure everyone has used our real life dictionary.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,420
So how do we use it?

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,350
What we do is we search for a word and then when we

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,350
get that word like we find it in a dictionary and

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,380
we see the definition against that word.

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,850
So how does it work

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:35,480
actually? A real live dictionary

12
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:35,480
has items, item1 , item2, item3.

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,630
Each item is basically like a word with a definition.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,350
So it goes on and on and on.

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:50,660
So I'm going to have items from A to Z in an English

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:50,660
dictionary and each item contains two things, a

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,720
key and a value.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,400
The key is the word you're searching for and

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,400
the value is a definition against that key.

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,650
So I'm going to give an example here. Let's say I want

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,650
to find what school means, the word school means.

22
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,060
So I look up school in my dictionary.

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:14,060
So school is my key and when I

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:14,060
find school I get a definition for

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,960
school and that's my value.

26
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,660
So for the school in my dictionary, I have a value which is its definition.

27
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:29,580
Similarly the same thing goes for coding

28
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:29,580
and then in my third item it's

29
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:29,580
Python, the key is Python.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,520
So when I search Python in a dictionary, I'm going to

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,520
a get definition for Python. That's going to be the

32
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,660
the keys value.

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,970
So how do we declare a dictionary in Python?

34
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,970
The very simple way to do this is

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:53,050
"my_dict" is equals to use this empty curly braces and

36
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:53,050
if print "my_dict" now you see I get these empty curly

37
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,100
braces. This indicates that my dictionary is empty now.

38
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:05,210
So how do we insert values or items in a dictionary

39
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:05,210
in Python? Python dictionaries works the same

40
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,230
way as real life dictionaries work.

41
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:14,360
I mean we have items and each

42
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:14,360
item contains a key and a value.

43
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:22,040
Each item contains a key and a

44
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:22,040
value and we get the value by accessing the key.

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:29,610
So if you want to find the definition of

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:29,610
school, we look school in our dictionary

47
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,400
and we find a definition for school here.

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,430
So that's the value for a school.

49
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,650
I'm going to build this dictionary,

50
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:45,800
"my_dict" dictionary using these three items. So I'm going to

51
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:45,800
insert my first item here, my first item is school,

52
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,860
the key school. I say "school" and

53
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,860
then I input this colon.

54
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:57,460
And I have the value now which is "definition of school".

55
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,160
Now I have a single item in my list. At the

56
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,160
left side of this colon I have school.

57
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:11,410
This is my key and at the right side of my colon and

58
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:11,410
I have the value which is definition of school.

59
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:19,180
Now if I want to insert another element what I do with

60
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:19,180
is I input a comma and then I repeat the same thing.

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:28,460
I say coding and then I input a colon and

62
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:28,460
then I have the value coding which is "definition

63
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,100
of coding".

64
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:36,860
Now same goes for my third element

65
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:36,860
which is Python. So "definition of Python".

66
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,650
So if I print my dictionary now.

67
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,540
Let's see what I get.

68
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:51,920
I've printed my dictionary and you can

69
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:51,920
see I have three items in my dictionary now.

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
They're all separated by a comma.

71
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,140
So my first item here says "Python",

72
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,170
second is coding, and third is school.

73
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,410
So each item contains two things a key and a value.

74
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,980
The key is at the left side of the colon and

75
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,980
the value is at the right side of the colon.

76
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,470
So here it says Python is the key and the

77
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,470
value for Python is "definition of Python".

78
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,510
Let's say I want to look up the definition of school.

79
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,850
So how am I going to do that?

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,650
I say print "my_dict", I use this empty square brackets

81
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,800
and I input my key.

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:39,430
I say "school" and if I print this now you see

83
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:39,430
it gives the value against this key, gains this key school here.

84
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,010
So one thing to note here, keys are unique.

85
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,920
You need to understand this.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,930
Keys are unique. I mean you can't have two keys saying school.

87
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,370
That's wrong.

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,350
You can't have two keys, two similar keys in a single dictionary.

89
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,050
That's wrong.

90
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,460
A key is unique, a key in a single dictionary is unique.

91
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,560
You can't repeat that, have two keys,

92
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,560
the same keys in a single dictionary.

93
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,170
OK, so let's add some more items to "my_dict".

94
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,870
So I want to add a definition for pen.

95
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:29,790
So what I do is I write "my_dict", I use these square

96
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:29,790
brackets and I say "pen" is equals to "definition of

97
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,710
pen" and if I print my dictionary now you can see I have

98
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,050
another item. I successfully inserted another item in my dictionary.

99
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,560
This is how I do this.

100
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,540
So how I insert a new item into my dictionary.

101
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,510
Like if I have to define one and then I

102
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,510
want insert another item in my dictionary,

103
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,860
I use this index.

104
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,360
OK.

105
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,950
So do you remember keys are unique and you

106
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,950
can't have two same keys in a single dictionary.

107
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:15,170
If I say "my_dict", I say "school", "key number 2",

108
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:15,170
it's just going to update the value of school.

109
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,850
So if I print "my_dict" now

110
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,380
against school I have now "key number 2".

111
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,380
I don't have another key named school.

112
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,680
You see how this works now. OK, good.

113
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:37,840
So one of the most commonly used method for dictionary

114
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:37,840
is "items". As we've discussed before a dictionary

115
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,090
has items like different items.

116
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,130
In our dictionary right now, I have one, two, three.

117
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,360
I have three items.

118
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,230
So let's say I want to know what items

119
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,230
I have and I want to do something about it.

120
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,940
Let's say I want to print them all in separate lines.

121
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,850
So what do I do.

122
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:10,120
I use a for loop, I say "for key,

123
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:10,120
value in my_dict.items" and I say print

124
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,640
"key", "value".

125
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,490
Now what happens is this "my_dict.items" is iterable.

126
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,990
This returns an iterable.

127
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,310
So one by one, it returns me each item and in

128
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,310
each item as I told you I have two things, I have

129
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,150
the key and the value.

130
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:36,330
So I say for key, comma value in

131
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:36,330
"my_dict.items", print "key" and "value".

132
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,130
So if I run this now, you can see

133
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,130
I have the keys here, on my left side.

134
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,630
The first key is "Python", it says

135
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,630
"definition of Python" and "coding" and then "school".

136
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,960
So this is how dictionaries work.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,260
This is a very basic introduction to what we can do

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,260
with dictionaries and one or one and one other thing

139
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,800
I forgot to mention is that the keys can be anything,

140
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,800
they can be any objects, they can be integers even like

141
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,030
I could say "my_dict[2]",

142
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,490
"the key is 2".

143
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:17,800
So if I print "my_dict" now, you see

144
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:17,800
I have four items.

145
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:26,260
Just let me remove this loop or comment it.

146
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,340
You can see I have four items in my dictionary now.

147
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,340
I have "coding", I have "school" and then I have this

148
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,710
element which has an integer as its key.

149
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:44,140
It has 2 as its key. If I say "my_dict[2]"

150
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:44,140
and print it, I get the key is 2.

151
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:51,200
And the value can be anything too, it is not restricted

152
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:51,200
to strings only, it can be any object.

153
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,920
You can have anything in there.

154
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,930
Maybe another dictionary if you want, a nested dictionary.

155
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,290
So I hope this is clear.

156
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,840
We'll move to tuples next.

157
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,570
And then we have list comprehension and dictionary

158
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,570
comprehensions and we'll this discuss this and more

159
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,410
