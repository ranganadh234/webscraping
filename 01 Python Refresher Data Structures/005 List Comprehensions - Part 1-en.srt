00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,420
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:12,910
Last time we discussed tuples, now we are at a

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:12,910
list comprehensions. List comprehension is another way

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:22,160
to make less and other more natural and refined way.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:22,160
Those some would say that this is a more complex

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,720
way of doing things.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,670
But I think in my personal opinion it's more neat

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,670
and it's more good looking and it doesn't

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,640
consume too much of your line when you actually write

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,640
it down that way when you actually make a list using

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,220
list comprehensions.

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,570
We'll just see how this works.

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,440
Let me first make you familiar with this module we have,

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,440
random, we'll be using a function of this

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,980
module.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,480
So what "random" does is

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,280
it prints random numbers.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,940
I mean like it gives us random numbers and we can

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,940
print them or we can do whatever we want with them and then

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,260
we'll be using this function "random.randInt".

21
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,730
It takes two values as its parameters.

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,890
The starting is like we give

23
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,890
it a range. Let's say I want

24
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,640
to generate a random number from zero to 100.

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:21,930
I'm to give it 0 to 100 and it will give me a

26
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:21,930
random number between this range. It will be between zero

27
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,440
to 100.

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:29,150
So if I run this, it gives me 24. If I run this again, it gives me 43.

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,210
So this is a function that you'll be using

30
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:41,720
making our list so that we have

31
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:41,720
random data in that and not just linear

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,630
values.

33
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:50,260
Ok, so I have made a list of

34
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:50,260
random values using a loop.

35
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,000
This list has 20 elements in that.

36
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,160
I'll just walk you through this.

37
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,800
I declare at line number five

38
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,710
a list, the name is "our_list" is equals to empty square brackets.

39
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,430
Then I have this loop which loops to 20 times.

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:13,780
So this loop is going to run for 20

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:13,780
times and each time it runs

42
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:22,220
what I do is I say "our_list.append", and I append a

43
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:22,220
random number with the range from 0 to 100 in my

44
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,540
list.

45
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,040
This list we have is our list.

46
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:36,980
So if I run this and I print it, I get a

47
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:36,980
list which has random values, random 20 values.

48
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,300
Let me just check the length of my list, that is "len(our_list)".

49
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,260
And we have 20 values in the list.

50
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:56,470
You can see that we have a list which has 20

51
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:56,470
elements in it and all of them have random values.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,740
All the elements are just random values.

53
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,840
OK.

54
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:07,770
So this was how we make a list of

55
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:07,770
random values using a loop.

56
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:14,570
So we consumed three sentences, three lines for

57
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:14,570
doing this. We wrote three statements for doing

58
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,990
this thing.

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,610
Now we're are going to make the same list.

60
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:26,660
But we are going to use list comprehension,

61
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:26,660
I say "new_list" is equal to this.

62
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:39,780
Now I have my loop here. The loop is "for value in the

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:39,780
range(0,20)" and this loop is going to run for

64
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:47,230
like 20 times and I say "value". If I print this,

65
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:58,130
I get a list which has linear values like from

66
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:58,130
0 to 19 like each time this "range" gives a value

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,190
I entered that in my list.

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,800
So this is basically an example of list comprehension.

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,620
So the syntax is that I use these square brackets.

70
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:19,040
I open them. At my left most, I have the value

71
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:19,040
which is going to be inserted into my list

72
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:31,410
so "value which is being inserted into my list"

73
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:31,410
then I have the "for" loop and I close these square

74
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:31,980
brackets.

75
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,430
And this is the basic syntax for a list comprehension.

76
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:45,330
Now what I want you to do is I want you to write

77
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:45,330
a new list which will have

78
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,200
random values and it should have 20 random values.

79
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:57,220
I mean you have to write this code and you have

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:57,220
to write it through list comprehensions. The syntax is at the

81
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:04,040
leftmost, you have the value which is being inserted

82
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:04,040
into your list like right now this variable

83
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,080
value is being inserted into my list each time this loop runs.

84
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:15,970
So I would suggest that you pause the screen now

85
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:15,970
and do this and when you have done it, give

86
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,540
it a shot.

87
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:22,450
And when you have done that then

88
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:22,450
continue again to see how we do this

89
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,660
if you are unable to do it.

90
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,130
OK, so I hope all of you have done it.

91
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:34,790
OK, so what we do is I say "new_list",

92
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:34,790
I say "random.randInt",

93
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,730
0, 100.

94
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:44,580
Now comes my loop, "for value in range(0,20)".

95
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,300
And if I print my list now.

96
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:54,930
Sorry, "new_list" now I get a list of

97
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:54,930
random values, 20 random values.

98
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,430
So what did I do.

99
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,300
All I did was I just changed this.

100
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,590
Here I had this variable "value" here.

101
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,690
All I did was I just changed that.

102
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,670
I call this function here, "randInt", which

103
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,670
gives me a variable,

104
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,270
a random value and that is inserted

105
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,110
each time the loop runs.

106
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:19,700
So this statement, that line number 16

107
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:19,700
is equal in these three statements

108
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:29,950
we wrote. This is a list comprehension, this is how we

109
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:29,950
make less using list comprehensions. You can see that

110
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,680
they're more neat.

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,540
They are more natural looking.

112
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,750
But for some of you,

113
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,390
some people would say that this is something complex.

114
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,820
So it would take time for you to get used

115
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,820
to this but this is a very neat way of doing things.

116
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,830
And I would highly recommend that you practice this, that

117
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,830
you make different lists using different values

118
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,940
and you practice more on this. And we'll discuss this more

119
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,910
in my next to you so I hope all of you understand what I told you today.

120
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,470
And thank you very much.

121
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,450
Have a nice day.
