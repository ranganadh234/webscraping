00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello everyone! For this course we are going to use an IDE for Python which is PyCharm.

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:15,220
So what you do is you go to Google and you write "download pycharm" on the first link which opens here

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,510
you open it up.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,240
I've opened it and it's here.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:27,850
So from here this tab gives me the option to download this IDE PyCharm and

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,420
it is provided for different operating systems like for Mac OS, Windows and Linux. It has two versions: Community

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,040
and Professional.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,940
We don't need Professional and it is also paid.

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,340
So what we do with you know Community works for us.

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,120
We download it and you can just download it from here.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,320
I've already downloaded it. After you have downloaded it.

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:56,190
You install it in your system and after doing that you just run that.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:03,430
So now I'm opening PyCharm. After the installation you open PyCharm and then this window opens

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,990
up.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,100
You say create new project and here you give it the bars like where you want your project to be.

16
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:22,430
So I say, you know, by making a folder on my Desktop, "web scrapping tutorials", and it create a project.

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:31,260
So this has created a Python project on my Desktop. Now create a test file just to test if

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,560
my Python file works or not.

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,220
And here I say "print('Hello world')".

20
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,280
So I run this and you can see that it works.

21
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,030
I can run it again and it works.

22
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,920
So this project is working.

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,270
So this is where, you know, we will continue our whole course.

24
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,540
And before we move forward with our course what I want you to do is I want you to download some of the

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,540
necessary modules which we will be using in our course.

26
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,290
So how do we do that.

27
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:14,650
You go to this this project, double click on it and then this opens up, you say "new",

28
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:23,000
"file" and here you make a file "requirements.txt".

29
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,910
So what I'm gonna do now here is that I'm going to list all the modules which I'm going to use in my course and

30
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,070
PyCharm is automatically going to download and install them for me.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,120
So I've made a list here, it's there. And I say Command-C

32
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,450
and Command-V so I'm sorry for this.

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,310
OK.

34
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:57,010
So here are the modules which we will be using for our course.

35
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,540
So what PyCharm is going to do now is it is going to download them install them for you itself

36
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,010
so you don't really need to worry about them anymore.

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,140
And in the next video when we start our course and I hope up till now that this is clear you and you

38
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,680
successfully install these modules as you will be using them extensively throughout our course.

39
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,630
Thank you very much.
