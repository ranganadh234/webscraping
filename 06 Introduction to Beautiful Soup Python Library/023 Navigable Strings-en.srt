Hello everyone! In the last lecture we talked about tags

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:07,750
and how we can access our tags attributes and

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,920
modify them.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,320
In this lecture, we are going to talk about bits of text

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,320
that are present in some of the tags. Like this "title"

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:23,510
tag here contains this text "Intro_to_soup" or the

7
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:23,510
"p" tag here, it contains "In first div".

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,300
And the second "p" tag contains "In second div".

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:36,960
So I want to make you more familiar with these tags.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:36,960
In Beautiful Soup,

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,720
We call them navigable strings.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,310
We call them, I will write this down, navigable strings.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,720
They are parsed as objects.

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,140
So how do we access these strings.

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,440
Let's say I want to get this string inside this "title" tag.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,680
So what I do is I get the "title" first.

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:09,630
I say "title" is equals to "soup.title",

18
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:09,630
then I say print "title.string". And if I run it,

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,660
it gives me "Intro_to_soup".

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:18,180
And if I run "print(title)", it gives me the whole tag.

21
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,930
So to get the string enclosed in a tag what we do is each tag has a method ".string".

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:35,400
And if that tag has a string object or it is enclosing some kind of string,

23
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,140
some navigable string, it prints it like as it did here.

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,790
So this navigable string object has another function which is ".replace_with".

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:52,380
So what we can do with this is we can actually replace the contents of the string.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:02,330
I'm just going to show you an example here. You can comment this first to make it more neat.

27
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,040
So I say I have the title here.

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:13,400
I can say "title.string.replace_with" and

29
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,740
"title has been changed".

30
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,310
So what I did was I said "title.string".

31
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:28,750
Now I got the navigable string object here and now I say ".replace_with" and "title has been changed".

32
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:37,870
And let's print "title" now to see if there is any change in the title tag or not.

33
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,790
And if I print, it says "title has been changed".

34
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:52,600
And before doing this if I print "title", it says "Intro_to_soup".

35
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:52,600
So this function ".replace_with"

36
00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:00,640
is a function of a navigable string and what it does

37
00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:00,640
is it changes the contents of the navigable

38
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,350
string.

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,990
So you can actually change the contents of any navigable string

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,990
in Beautiful Soup using this

41
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,460
".replace_with" function.

42
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:20,270
I hope this is more clear to you and I would like

43
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:20,270
you to go through this yourself and practice,

44
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:20,980
you know.

45
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:27,640
Just play with this and access different tags and

46
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:27,640
try to access the strings and then modify them.

47
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,110
Thank you very much.
