Hello everyone!

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,350
In the last video, we discussed the "next_sibling" method of a tag.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:15,720
In this video, we are going to discuss the "previous_sibling"

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:15,720
method of a tag. As we saw earlier in our previous

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:24,960
video, we saw that if I'm at this "p" tag, I could move

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:24,960
this "p" tag using not using the ".next_sibling" method.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:33,370
And similarly I could move to this, the last "p" tag,

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:33,370
which is the last tag which is the last

9
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,520
last sibling here of this tag.

10
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:42,830
So with the "next_sibling" we can go forward. We

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:42,830
can actually move forward over tags or other

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:52,300
tag siblings. So we have a method in Beautiful

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:52,300
Soup which allows us to move backwards as well.

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,630
It allows us to move backwards.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:03,960
Like if I'm here I can move to this "b" tag or this

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:03,960
"p" tag using a method which will allow me to

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,080
walk over my siblings backwards.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,050
The "next_sibling" method what it does was it

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,050
allowed us to walk forwards over our siblings.

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:20,280
This method here, "previous_sibling", it allows

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:20,280
us to move backwards over our sibling tags.

22
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:31,150
So what I'm to do now is I've made a soup of this file

23
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:31,150
here, this "three_sisters.html" and now I am going to

24
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,060
print the contents of my HTML.

25
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:41,360
OK, so you can see I have this "body" tag here.

26
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:41,750
OK.

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,810
And before that "body" tag I have a new line

28
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,810
character which we are going to ignore.

29
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
And then I have this "head" tag.

30
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:57,820
So what I want to do now is I say that I'm at "body"

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:57,820
and I want to move back to my previous sibling.

32
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,350
So we are going to do that now and see how we do this.

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,760
So I have this "body" variable which is the

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,760
"body" tag. "body" is equals to "soup.body".

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:15,370
So what I do is I say print, and

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:15,370
comment this here. I say for print

37
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,830
"body.previous_sibling".

38
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,520
This will give me the new line character.

39
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,270
This one here. We don't want that, we

40
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,270
want to move our "head" tag.

41
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,730
So if I just run this, you can see it

42
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,730
gives me nothing except for a new line.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,340
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to have to

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,340
input this again and just say "previous_sibling"

45
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,260
So if I do this, now it gives me the "head" tag.

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,420
You can see this here.

47
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,910
So using this "previous_sibling" method,

48
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,910
we've successfully moved backwards to our "head" tag.

49
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,540
And we were at our "body" tag initially and using

50
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,540
this method we have gone to our "head" tag.

51
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:10,150
So we have discussed right now two

52
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:10,150
ways of moving sideways. One is

53
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:17,280
that we move moved downwards, like to the next siblings,

54
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:17,280
and other method is the "previous_sibling", like

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:23,090
we move backwards to our previous siblings.

56
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,600
This example illustrates this concept better.

57
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,600
If I'm at body,

58
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,440
I can move backwards to "head".

59
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,320
So I'll use "previous_sibling" method. And if I'm at the "head"

60
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,320
and I have to move to "body", I'll use the "next_sibling"

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,000
method.

62
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,590
OK.

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:47,150
So next we'll discuss the methods "next_siblings"

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:47,150
and "previous_siblings". I hope up till now

65
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,310
this is clear to you.

66
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,710
And thank you very much.

67
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,610
See you soon.
