00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:09,400
Hello everyone! In the last video, we discussed how we can

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:09,400
move up our parse tree. In this video, we are going to discuss how

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,940
we can move downwards in our parse tree.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,960
As we discussed earlier, there are three

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,960
types of basic movements in our parse tree.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,100
One is that we move downwards.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,960
Let's say from the "html" level to this "body"

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,960
and then to this "p" and then do this "b.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,260
So I have been moving downwards in this scenario.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,840
Another is that it moves upwards. Let's say if I'm at this

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,840
"b" tag, I move to this "p", then to this "body", then

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:42,230
to this "html". In upwards, we are moving towards a parent,

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:42,230
and in downwards, we are moving towards a child.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,390
Then there's this third type of movement which we are

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,390
going to discuss today. That is like we move sideways.

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:56,340
If I'm at this "p" tag, I move to this "b" or to this

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:56,340
"p" or to this "p". When you make a tree of this

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:04,830
HTML, we can see that these all tags, this "b" tag, this

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:04,830
"p" tag, this "p" and this "p", they are the same level.

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,590
We can call them siblings.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:18,180
So I've read this file here and I made a soup of

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:18,180
this file here then I have my "body" tag and

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,890
and I have to first "p" tag.

24
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,960
So if I print "p".

25
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:33,000
It gives me the "p" tag with

26
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:33,000
"class='title'", which is this here.

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,040
OK, so

28
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,600
now what I want to do is I

29
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,600
want to move at the same level.

30
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,630
So either I want to get to this B or I want

31
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,630
to get to this "p" tag which has "class='story'".

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,580
So what can I do know? If I print "body.contents",

33
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:06,970
you can see that the first child of "body" is this

34
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:06,970
new new line character which we are going to

35
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,540
omit, we are not going to consider that.

36
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,540
Then the first child is this "b" tag.

37
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:22,010
Then the next child is this "p" tag and the next child is then

38
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:22,010
again a new line character which we are not going to consider

39
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,880
as a child and then we have the story one.

40
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:33,510
So what we want to do is: currently we are

41
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:33,510
here at this tag and we want to move to "p" here.

42
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,430
So what can we do.

43
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:45,090
So I mean we have to move two places. Like in one place,

44
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:45,090
I have this new line character and if I move to

45
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,580
the right again then I could go to this "p" tag.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,330
So I'm just going to run so it's more clear.

47
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:01,400
Now we have this function in Beautiful Soup, this tag function.

48
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,480
What this does is if I say print "p.next_sibling"

49
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,320
and then again "next_sibling".

50
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:26,450
The reason I'm doing this "next_sibling" again is because

51
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:26,450
as you can see that I have this new line character

52
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,510
which I have to omit.

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,760
So if I do this once and

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,800
if I run it, this doesn't give me anything because it's

55
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,800
a new line character that just prints a new line.

56
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,550
So if I do it twice.

57
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,770
You see I have moved to the next "p" tag.

58
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,340
So I've successfully moved to the next "p" tag.

59
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,340
I've moved sideways successfully.

60
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,870
So this can be done like

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,960
if you are at our "head", we could move to this

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,960
"body" tag using the same method, "next_sibling".

63
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,970
So the "next_sibling" method, what this does

64
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,970
is this allows us to move sideways in our parse tree.

65
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,780
It allows us to move to our siblings, our next siblings.

66
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,780
In the next video, we will discuss how to move

67
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,160
to our previous siblings.

68
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,450
Let's say I'm at this "body". How do I move to "head"?

69
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,450
I can't do that with that next sibling

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,580
because "body" has no next sibling. "body" is the last sibling,

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,580
"head" has next sibling which is this "body"

72
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,390
tag here.

73
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,340
So I hope this is clear to you and I'll elaborate this more.

74
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,500
Once we get to "previous_sibling" and we'll discuss this more there then.

75
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:44,980
Thank you.
