Hello everyone! In this lecture we're going to discuss HTML.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:13,080
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a format system which is used to display graphics, text, audio

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,780
over the internet.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,610
I'm sure all of you are familiar with HTML and I'm just going to put a review to the most basic

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,090
elements in HTML.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:32,520
So in HTML have tags. A dog is a hidden keyword which sets the layout, how a browser

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,830
is going to display the content in that tag.

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:46,840
So here in this sample HTMl page I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven tags.

9
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,380
So if I open this "tags.txt", I have written them down.

10
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,410
I have html, head, meta, title, body,

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,440
p and p. So if I run this on the browser, you'll see I get this here.

12
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:12,090
So this <p> tag here is defining that whatever comes here, whatever comes between these tags has

13
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,870
the color blue.

14
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,510
So if I see it here, I have this text here, the string here.

15
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,130
It says some text here and it's in blue.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,700
So the next <p> tag I have has a "font-style: italic" and you can see that this text here is italic.

17
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:34,300
So the style thing, that's an attribute of the p tag, we call these attributes.

18
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,790
This is an attribute.

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,330
So the <p> tag here has a attribute style is equal to "color: blue".

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:48,860
And its font-style is italic. You can think of a HTML page as a tree, or having a tree structure.

21
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,890
For this file,

22
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:57,640
the tree would be that on the very top. I have HTML and then it has two children's: head and body. Then

23
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:04,280
heads for the two childrens: meta and title. And body has again two children P and P.

24
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:12,660
So this is a very basic summary of what HTML is and how we can interpret HTML

25
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,350
so that in future we are able to parse it efficiently.

26
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,340
I'm sure I've made myself clear and thank you very much for your time.
