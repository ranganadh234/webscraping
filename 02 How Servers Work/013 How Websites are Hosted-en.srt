Hello everyone! Today we will discuss how web sites are hosted on servers and how do we access them.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,550
So let's go with a very simple scenario.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:19,570
What happens is that a user opens his browser and then, let's say, he inputs there

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,770
"Google.com".

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,640
So what the browser does is: browser sends the request to Google server.

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:38,660
Server receives this request and processes it and then server returns response to browser. Browser

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:47,430
displays the response the server sent and then Google home page opens which the user can now see.

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,150
So the basic workflow is: user sends a request, server gets it.

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,490
Server processes it and then sends the response back to the user.

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:05,390
So the user is able to see what the server has sent which in our case right now is the Google home page.

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,390
So this is how web sites are basically hosted on servers.

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,620
I mean like a very basic view of how this works.

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,390
A request to send by user, server receives request, processes it and then sends back a response.

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,690
I hope this is very simple and I hope this is clear to you right now.

15
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,140
Thank you very much.
