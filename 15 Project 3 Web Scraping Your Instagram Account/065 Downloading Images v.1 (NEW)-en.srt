00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,210
Hello everyone! In this video, we are going

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,210
to finally move on to downloading the images.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,050
We have everything necessary in place to do that.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,530
We have the folders, we have scroll down.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,520
We have ensured that all the images

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,520
are loaded on our page. So moving on

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,660
to the final part.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,980
Now what do we do here?

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:29,230
So if you see that I have these image tags and

10
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:29,230
they contain the image here, pretty obvious.

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:36,250
So one way can be you we do is we we get

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:36,250
all the images on this page which are going

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,070
to be...

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:45,520
So we have three images in a single row and we have one,

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:45,520
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,330
We have 10 rows and this is the 11th image the display picture.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,530
So OK.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,640
Ten three, thirty.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,930
And this makes it 31 right.

20
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,950
OK, moving forward I'm going to

21
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,950
write a function "downloading"...

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,880
"downloading_images".

23
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,920
So what do we do here is I say

24
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,920
that I'm going to make a soup now.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,140
Let me first have

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,140
the necessary library imports.

27
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,160
I say "soup" is equals to "BeautifulSoup"

28
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:40,680
and "self.driver.page_source" and then I provide a parser.

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:40,680
Ok, so now we want to find all the images

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,100
so I say "soup.find_all".

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,190
And I got the image tag.

32
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,940
I can say print

33
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:57,680
"Length of all images" and I say "len(all_images)"

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,660
"for img and all_images"

35
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,410
print "image['src']".

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,040
So we have the address of this image in the source

37
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,260
attribute. I'm just going to show that to you.

38
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:25,630
You see this here like we have this source

39
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:25,630
attribute and it contains the image itself.

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:34,190
If I copy this, just to show you how

41
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:34,190
this works, it get the image. Right.

42
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,520
OK, so what what we basically need is we

43
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,520
basically need the source attribute of the image.

44
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,700
So once I have all the image tags, I extract

45
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,700
the image source attribute. I'm going to run this now.

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,520
And we'll see how this goes.

47
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,820
OK, I'm sorry I didn't call that.

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,390
I didn't call the downloading function.

49
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,900
So we have to do that obviously, "downloading_images".

50
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:15,370
OK, so now it's opening Instagram.

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,180
It's going to log us in now.

52
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,530
So now we have the dialog box, it closed

53
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,530
dialog box, opening our target profile.

54
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:52,170
It's going to move to scrolling now.

55
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,750
So now that we have scrolled down, let's have our

56
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,750
PyCharm here and see how this goes with the images.

57
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,270
OK.

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,230
So there you go.

59
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,490
We have all the image links and the

60
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,490
length of all images is thirty one.

61
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:14,690
Just as we calculated, right. Ten rows that

62
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:14,690
make 30 and 30 first images a display picture here.

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,090
If I copy any of this like if I copy this

64
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,000
and just try this out here.

65
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:32,060
You see I'm getting a picture which I

66
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:32,060
have on my target's profile, right.

67
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:41,560
It's this picture, you can see this. So basically

68
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:41,560
we have the image attributes now, the image sources like

69
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,850
we have the image tags and the necessary attributes

70
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,850
that come with the source and the caption.

71
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,260
We are going to discuss more about captions

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,260
in the next coming videos.

73
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,080
And next video, we are going to discuss how we going

74
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,080
to actually download this image onto our system

75
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,890
now like we have access to the image, we have necessary links.

76
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,910
Now what we want to do is we want to download this image on our system.

77
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,530
We are going to discuss that in the next video.

78
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,490
I hope this video made sense and if anything

79
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,490
isn't clear, you can always leave questions. Thank you!
