00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,270
Hello everyone! In this video, we are going to

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,270
discuss where we are going to download our photos.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:14,790
Now we have this parameter coming "path". This argument.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:14,790
So it tells us the location of where are going to

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,120
download our photos here.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:25,450
OK, so to ensure I'm downloading in the right

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:25,450
directory I have to ensure this path exists.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,330
It is a check which I have to ensure, right.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,450
So if I open my desktop, can you see any folder name "instaPhotos"?

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,270
It is not there but here in the "path"

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,270
it states that "Desktop/instaPhotos".

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,280
But I don't have any folder "instaPhotos" in my desktop.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,370
So what do we do now.

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,770
The first thing which needs to be done is to

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,770
ensure that does this path exist

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,390
which the user entered.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,910
So I am going to import "os" here, "os" is a module.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,310
It's a built in module. You do not have to download it.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,590
We have "pep".

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,230
So it's it comes with Python.

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,570
OK.

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,630
So what we are going to do is we're going

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,630
to use "os" to see if this path exists.

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:18,080
This path which we have and if it doesn't exist

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:18,080
we're going to make sure that it exists now. And how we

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,560
are going to make sure that, we are going to create it.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,260
OK, so what we are going to do is I'm going to open to

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,260
Selenium and go to this that whole process. I'm just

29
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:40,100
going to say "input" this is just to stop

30
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:40,100
the execution of the program. "stop for now".

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,600
And before that I say print

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,700
so the function that you're going to use is "os.path.exists"

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,520
and here I give it "path".

34
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,310
So this going to return me a boolean value, true or false.

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,790
If the file exists it is going to return me

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,790
"True" if it doesn't it is going to tell me false.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm going to run this.

38
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,360
And let's see what we get.

39
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:16,530
So it says "False", can you see the that? That means

40
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:16,530
that this path doesn't exist and that is very true.

41
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,190
We don't have any folder "instaPhotos" in my desktop.

42
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,880
So how do we take care of this?

43
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,530
So how we do that is is it says "os.mkdir".

44
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,130
And then you give it "path".

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,720
I'm going to run this now this like here

46
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,720
with this like we we're supposed to run this.

47
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,190
It is just to show you walk

48
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,190
you through the function here.

49
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:47,470
So make directory, "mkdir", what this function

50
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:47,470
does is it is going to create this directory

51
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,420
here, this "instaPhotos" directory here.

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,010
If it doesn't exist already on the desktop and

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,010
how we're going to do this is we are going to sat "if not

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,300
os.path.exists"

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,160
then "os.mkdir(path)".

56
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,570
Now what this line is going to do is this line is going

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,570
to ensure that this directory does exist in our

58
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,140
system and if it doesn't exist we are going to create it.

59
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,670
OK.

60
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:23,590
And I'm going to copy this and I'm going to say if "self.error" is "False".

61
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,040
Here you go.

62
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,280
Now let's run this and see if we get the directory.

63
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,190
OK.

64
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,660
With this specified path, I hope this is making sense to you.

65
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,020
I'm going to run this now.

66
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,280
There we go.

67
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:53,780
The reason I have this after all this is that say

68
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:53,780
that I got an error while logging in then it's

69
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,820
no use making a directory which is not going to be used.

70
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,140
Right.

71
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,560
We only make it until it's absolutely necessary to do that.

72
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,120
OK.

73
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,630
So now we're logged into Instagram

74
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,440
opening target's profile.

75
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,450
Scrolling down, scrolling down

76
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,170
and we should have our directory any time now

77
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,170
and here it is, "instaPhotos". Can you see this?

78
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,950
"instaPhotos".

79
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,480
So our code created this directory because it found that

80
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,480
it doesn't exist already in our system. OK.

81
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,360
Great. So in the next video, we're going

82
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,360
to discuss the downloading part.

83
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,970
Now as we have the directory the location of where we

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,970
are going to store our photos and we have ensured

85
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,510
that location exists on our system.

86
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,410
OK, I'll see you in the next video.

87
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:09,900
Thank you.
