00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:07,350
Hello everyone! In this video, we're going to

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:07,350
discuss how we're going to open the targets profile.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,920
So by now all of us should be logged in.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,930
And if any of you isn't logged in then you should check

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,930
out the previous video in which we did a login for

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,130
Instagram.

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,160
So as soon as you log in you can see that this dialog box appears.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,270
So now this may be appearing for some of

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,270
you and for some of you it may not be appearing.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,400
So for those people who are seeing this dialog

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,400
box don't worry, we're just going to

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,530
see how are we going to handle it with our code and for those

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,410
who are not seeing any dialog boxes,

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,750
well we're going to move forward with

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,750
opening the target's profile which we will discuss in

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,400
a few minutes.

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,690
OK.

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,730
So the question is how do we close the dialog box.

19
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,960
Very simple answer.

20
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,880
There is this cross mark.

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:01,180
So what we do is we find that HTML for

22
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:01,180
this cross and we're going to then

23
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,630
click on this button and it is going to close the

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,630
dialog box. So we can see that this is a button which

25
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,590
has the class "_dbnr9".

26
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,920
OK, so let's write a function now which is going to close dialog box

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,260
and I'm going to write this "try except". The reason is that

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,260
if there is no dialog box it

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,030
may disappear or it may not be appearing for some people right now.

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,890
If they have this code running with their

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,890
script it isn't going to come

32
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,480
and crash down things that have come crashing down.

33
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,610
The script is still going to work so that's

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,610
why I'm just having the "try except" block here.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,340
OK, so I need to do this "sleep" first and then I say

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,340
"close_button" is equals to "self.driver.find_element_by_xpath"

37
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,660
We are looking forward for a button with class.

38
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:12,660
Ok, and then say "cloase_button.click" and

39
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:12,660
I can introduce another sleep for one second.

40
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,940
OK, so now I'm going to close this function

41
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,940
and let's see if this works or not.

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,550
OK.

43
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm running this now.

44
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,720
OK.

45
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,530
Insta

46
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,890
and now we are logged in.

47
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,570
And it is.

48
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,040
OK.

49
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,670
So great.

50
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,330
This work, it close the dialog box.

51
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:51,080
OK, so now that's done what we want to do

52
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:51,080
is we want to open our profile.

53
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,660
So in our case, the guy whose profile we want

54
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,660
to open is "dataminer2060".

55
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,060
So we're going to type it here.

56
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,860
And now we are going to type it here.

57
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,090
And then as we move forward to "dataminer60" profile,

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,090
we can see the URL of Instagram

59
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,350
is "instagram.com/" then

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,090
it's the username of the profile you're trying to open.

61
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,660
And then another forward slash.

62
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,080
So now what we are going to do is first

63
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,080
we're going to write that "dataminer2060"

64
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,240
here and then going to click Enter

65
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,240
because it might display multiple

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,420
results and there might be some other guy who has his name "dataminer".

67
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,820
So it is possible that it might display

68
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,820
multiple results for some other user names.

69
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,340
So what we do is we find a fail proof

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,340
method which is that we add the user

71
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,090
name after "Instagram.com".

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,470
I'll just show you how this is going to be done.

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,710
But first let's input our desired to user name here.

74
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:05,720
So let's check out the HTML for this search bar.

75
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,350
So it's basically

76
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,540
"span" and it's basically this "div".

77
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,070
No, it's a simple tag here.

78
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,640
OK.

79
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:30,860
So you can see that this "input" tag has this class and

80
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:30,860
I'm going to find "def open_target_profile"

81
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,590
I'm going to find this

82
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,920
and here we go. OK.

83
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:54,090
So I say "search_bar.send_keys" and

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:54,090
that is going to be "self.target_username".

85
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,420
And let's keep to that for now.

86
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,820
See if we're able to input anything there.

87
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:13,230
So "self.open_target_profile". OK I'm running this now,

88
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:13,230
let's see if we're able to input target's

89
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,480
username in that search bar.

90
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,930
OK, so we are logged in.

91
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,150
It should close the dialog box now.

92
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,340
And yes, there we go.

93
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,770
You can see that it has successfully inserted

94
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,770
the target profile's username into the search

95
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,720
field.

96
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,260
So this is working.

97
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,440
What do we want to do next

98
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:46,900
is if I write "dataminer2060" here, and I open it

99
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:46,900
you can see that the URL of Instagram

100
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,360
has changed. It is now "instagram.com/dataminer2060".

101
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,390
OK.

102
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,620
So how am I going to open the target's profile.

103
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:07,090
What I to do is to say "target_profile_url"

104
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:07,090
is equals to "self.main_url".

105
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,310
Now you can see that the "main_url"

106
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,560
is "https://www.instagram.com".

107
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,610
OK.

108
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:20,360
And what we're going to do is we are going to

109
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:20,360
insert a forward slash here and then "self.target_username"

110
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,710
then

111
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,100
another forward slash.

112
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:32,990
Now I'm going to say "self.driver.get",

113
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:32,990
"target_profile_url" and let's introduce the sleep

114
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,230
for two seconds.

115
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,050
OK.

116
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:52,090
And I'm going to run this now and this

117
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:52,090
should open our target usernames profile.

118
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,530
So it's going to close the dialog box.

119
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,710
There you go.

120
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,990
So you saw that what we did was we

121
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,990
added a forward slash to the main URL,

122
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,590
our main URL was this, the portion I've highlighted.

123
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,100
I added a forward slash and then there's this target

124
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,100
profile username and then the forward slash and

125
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:20,340
it opens up our target username's profile which in this case is ours.

126
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,320
In the next video, we are going to discuss

127
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,320
how we're going to download the photos from

128
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,810
a target's profile here.

129
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,970
See you in the next video.

130
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,990
I hope this video makes sense.

131
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,520
Thank you.
