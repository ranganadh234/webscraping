Hello everyone! In this video, we are going to discuss

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:08,280
your final project and I'm going to brief you about what

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,200
we are supposed to do in your final project.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,450
So I'm sure all of you have used Instagram before and

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,450
I mean it must be like let's say you

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,760
have uploaded 400 or 500 photos and now you want to

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,760
have a copy of each photo on your PC or somewhere.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,260
So what are you going to do?

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,190
Don't tell me that you are going to open each photo and then

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,190
you're going to download them separately and

11
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,470
then using your phone.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,880
So what do you suggest.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,440
Like what can we do now.

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,350
So the task at hand is that

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:49,820
we are going to write a scraper for downloading

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:49,820
images from Instagram for any user

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:57,100
with we are friends with or with open

18
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:57,100
privacy like you can access the profile

19
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,000
openly.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,640
So how can you go about this.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,940
I'm just going to give you an overview. So you know

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,940
the first thing you do is you log into Instagram

23
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,970
and then you will say "dataminer2060".

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,190
I mean these are the credentials I'm

25
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,190
using and I'll provide them to you

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,090
but you can also use your own account if you want to.

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,640
OK, so and I'm going to log in now.

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,210
So this is what you are supposed to do. You are going to log in to Instagram.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,980
Then you're going to open your own profile.

30
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:31,810
OK.

31
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,620
You need to open your own profile.

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,690
You're going to see how many photos are here.

33
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,720
So here they are 30 photos.

34
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,260
And if I scroll down, you see I don't get 30 photos

35
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,260
at once so I have to click this "Load

36
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,500
more" button. Ater doing that,

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,330
I have to scroll down because all the photos are

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,330
present, AJAX is being used here.

39
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:00,620
So then I scroll down and after I'm done

40
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:00,620
with that, after all the photos have been loaded

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,010
what I do is I download them, I download each photo.

42
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:14,180
And with that I also want to get the

43
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:14,180
status for each photo, the caption for each photo.

44
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,310
So this is the caption here.

45
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,380
This is the caption here.

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,530
I also want that.

47
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,150
So this is what you are supposed

48
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,150
to do for the final project.

49
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,070
So the user can give any username. OK.

50
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,860
It could be like your own username.

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,690
I mean the one who's using it.

52
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,580
So if he wants to get his images and stuff, he can

53
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,580
do that like it can be anyone's

54
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,980
username.

55
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:45,730
But

56
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,620
the privacy should be open to

57
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,620
that person who's accessing

58
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,640
their Instagram. So let's say if you

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,960
want to download my Instagram photos

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,960
but we are not friends on Instagram.

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,690
My privacy is private.

62
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,630
You can't download them so that you actually

63
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,630
need to be friend, you need to follow them.

64
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,180
OK.

65
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,410
And they have to give you access.

66
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,840
So if that's done then you can download their images.

67
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,070
But we'll stick with downloading our own images right now.

68
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,620
OK.

69
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,270
So this is what

70
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:28,360
your final project is about and I wish to use the

71
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:28,360
object oriented programming approach for doing this.

72
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,610
There would be many things we learned along the way.

73
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,270
Many more things, little things that we haven't really

74
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,780
covered so I'll see you soon

75
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,840
In the solution videos. Thank you very much.
