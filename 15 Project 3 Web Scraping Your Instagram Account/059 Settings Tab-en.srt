00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,680
Hello everyone! In this video, we are going to discuss

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,680
how to resolve the settings tag issue which we faced in

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,210
part one when we were trying to log in.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:19,160
So the issue was that when we logged in a new tab

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:19,160
open up, a Settings tab, and my main window,

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,610
my Instagram window, it went out of focus.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,790
So I'm just going to run this so we have the issue

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,790
in front of us and then we can discuss how

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,570
to resolve it.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,140
OK.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,490
So it is going to log in now and

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,490
setting tab is going to open any time now.

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,790
And there it is.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,650
OK so the reason why.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,900
Why does this occur.

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:51,170
This occurs because we are at version 62 of Google

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:51,170
Chrome and the Chrome driver with engine is

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,140
2.33.

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:59,380
So these are both the latest versions for the Chrome

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:59,380
drivers which I have right now and the Chrome.

21
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:05,570
So there's a bug in these builds and that's

22
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:05,570
why this issue is coming right now.

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,220
So many of you this might not be happening

24
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,220
if you don't have the latest versions of Chrome

25
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,400
and Chrome driver.

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:18,110
If you don't want to resolve this with your code, you

27
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:18,110
can just downgrade your Chrome to version 59 and

28
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,710
everything should be fine.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,260
If you don't want to do that and you want to resolve

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,260
this with our code, we are going to discuss how they are going

31
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,690
to do it.

32
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,760
So if this issue is not happening for you, don't worry about it.

33
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,420
It's good.

34
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,640
If it's not happening,

35
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,500
you can just skip this video and move for the next ones.

36
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,850
And for those of you this issue is occurring just hear me out.

37
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:46,550
You can just implement the solution where this issue occurs

38
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,640
for you because the location might change for you.

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,970
For some it might happen after logging in, for some it

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,970
might happen at a later stage or even

41
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,430
at an earlier stage.

42
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,780
OK.

43
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:06,120
So let's move forward and just discuss the solution

44
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:06,120
we have. So right now, in this Chrome instance we have

45
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,030
two windows, the first window is Instagram

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,030
and second window is settings.

47
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,510
OK.

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,980
Two windows, windows 0 Instagram, window one settings.

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,590
So in Selenium we have this variable known as window handles.

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,920
It is a list and it contains references to

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,920
each window in that Chrome instance.

52
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,270
So this window handles object

53
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,740
at zero index it has Instagram and in that one index it has settings.

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,840
Now what we want to do is we want to close this Settings tab.

55
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,280
And where is this our Selenium window handles list.

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,070
It is at index number one.

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,180
Now let's write some code and you'll

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,180
have a clear idea of what I'm saying here.

59
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:59,960
"close_setting_tab". I'm going to write this and "try except".

60
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,690
And the reason is that for those this issue is rising,

61
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,640
they have this code in their "log_in" function or

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,640
"profile" function, it is not going to hurt

63
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,120
them if they just call this function.

64
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:23,470
Ok, so I say "self.driver.switch_to_window".

65
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:23,470
Now which window do I want to switch to, I want

66
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,210
to switch to the settings window. I just want to make sure that

67
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,230
I'm actually there.

68
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:29,880
OK.

69
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,770
And then I'm going to close this tab.

70
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,700
So I say "self.driver

71
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,570
.window_handles". This "window_handles" is a list.

72
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,540
I tell it "Open window_handle[1]".

73
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,120
So now this line which we just showed,

74
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,790
it ensures that I am at this settings tag.

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,790
Then I say "self.driver.close".

76
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,890
This means that I've closed

77
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,310
the settings tab. OK, perfect.

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,490
Ok, so now what I want to do is I want to my Instagram window

79
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,860
be the main focus of our code right now.

80
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:19,200
So now I shift the focus back to Instagram, I say "switch_to_window",

81
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:19,200
say "self.driver.window_handles[0]"

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,190
because Instagram was window number zero or the first window.

83
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:31,390
And in Python we start counting from zero and

84
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:31,390
it's the same for most programming languages. OK.

85
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,460
So now let's call this function "close_settings_tab".

86
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,600
And let's see if it actually does that or not.

87
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,490
I'm going to run this now.

88
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:50,460
So Instagram log in.

89
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,590
So that was really quick.

90
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,480
OK.

91
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,620
The settings tab didn open up and they closed it fairly quickly.

92
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,560
So this bug has been resolved.

93
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,970
And in the next video, we are going to discuss how

94
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,970
we're going to open our target users profile.

95
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,810
I hope you understood how we did this.

96
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,510
Thank you.
