1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,960
Welcome everybody to this course.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,620
Merely glad that all of you are here.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,970
Thank you again for checking out this course.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:15,980
So I'll start up explaining what scrapping is as this course is all about web scrapping.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,650
So in simple and brief terms, scrapping is extracting data from the Internet.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,810
Why do we need to do that?

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,010
That's a valid question.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,660
Why do we need to extract data from the Internet?

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,200
So we live in an age where everything is being uploaded on the internet.

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,180
Like daily terabytes of data is being uploaded on the Internet.

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:43,040
And with such amount of data you could to perform analysis and you would actually improve a lot of things

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,360
that if you're a businessman and if you're launching your product, you can learn more about the market

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,430
like "OK, what do people like?" How they...

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:58,220
How early, you know, how will they respond to your product launch or how can you improve

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,140
your product.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,510
But all of this information is on the Internet.

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,150
So you need some tool, you need some way to actually get that information out of the Internet.

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,410
One way would be too hard.

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:14,540
Hundreds of persons to do this stuff or the other way, the smart way, would be that he'd write a computer

20
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,340
program which does this for you, you know, and conserves your resources.

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,510
So this is what web scrapping is about.

22
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:30,660
So the next question is what is this course about. This course is about like how can we access web pages

23
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,680
programmatically, you know. We'll be using Python for this course.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:43,240
So this course will teach us how we can parse a web page, extract required data,

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,080
to extract data from that page. Like let's say you want to get photos from some web page you

26
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,820
know how are you going to do that.

27
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,940
Let's say there are thousands of photos.

28
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,910
Don't tell me that you're going to download each of them individually, you know.

29
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,300
I mean that is going to take a lot of time.

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:07,140
So we will learn how to parse a web page and extract our required data from our web pages.

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,310
So we will cover this stuff in this course.

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,740
And next, you know, Python has this module which is known as Beautiful Soup.

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,670
This is a parser for parsing web pages.

34
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,600
We'll learn this too in this course.

35
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,310
So in this course we'll also learn how we can interact differently with our pages and how we can move

36
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,720
around.

37
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,500
And later on with them you know do different stuff.

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:37,660
So we'll also learn that and you could say that it is an introduction to

39
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,410
automation, in automating different stuff on the Internet.

40
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,600
You can say that in simple terms.

41
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,100
So we'll be using Selenium for interacting with web pages in this course.

42
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:55,120
So to like, you know, to sum it up, to sum this question, you know, like for daunt of this question.

43
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,090
I can say that briefly that's about how we can extract data from any kind of web page using a programming

44
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,700
language.

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,800
In our case, it is going to be Python.

46
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:10,080
So the last thing is that what will you learn by the end of this course.

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:10,080
At the end of this course you

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,030
will have a deep understanding of how web sites and servers function. Like how are websites hosted and

49
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,700
how do they send requests to servers, what are servers, what are Web sites and how does this

50
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,560
communication take place.

51
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,220
So you'll have a deeper understanding of how this works, how all of this works.

52
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:36,310
Then you'll learn different extraction techniques which are being used worldwide, you know, the best

53
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,060
practices, the worst practices, things you have to worry, things you have to keep in mind while you

54
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:48,210
are scrapping data, you know, and how can you do this in an efficient manner.

55
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,390
You'll learn this by the end of this course.

56
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,350
So and, you know, like we will also learn how to

57
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,490
handle a lot of data and how we can actually parse that data.

58
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,240
And, you know, get it in the required format we want.

59
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,670
So I really look forward to.

60
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:16,490
I really look forward to teaching in this course. So I hope that you're excited about this.

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,860
So I think let's get to our first tutorial so I'll see you soon in the next video.

62
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,350
Thank you.
